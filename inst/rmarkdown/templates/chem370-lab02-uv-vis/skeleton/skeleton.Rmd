## Assessment

Answer the following questions by saving the result as the specified R variable in an R code block.  These questions are graded automatically.  If you do not name your variable correctly (including capitals) your questions will be marked incorrect.

Each question is worth 1 point.  You must get the question *exactly* right to get credit.

## Assessment

Answer the following questions by saving the result as the specified R variable in an R code block.  These questions are graded automatically.  If you do not name your variable correctly (including capitals) your questions will be marked incorrect.

Each question is worth 1 point.  You must get the question *exactly* right to get credit.

1. What is the quinine concentration in your sample, in mg/L?  Call the variable `quinine`.

```{r question-1, purl = TRUE}
quinine <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

2. What is the 95% confidence interval (CI) for quinine concentration in your sample, in mg/L?  Call the variable `quinine_ci`.

```{r question-2, purl = TRUE}
quinine_ci <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

3. What is the quinine concentration in your QC, in mg/L?  Call the variable `quinine_qc`.

```{r question-3, purl = TRUE}
quinine_qc <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

4. What is the 95% confidence interval (CI) for quinine concentration in your QC, in mg/L?  Call the variable `quinine_qc_ci`.

```{r question-4, purl = TRUE}
quinine_qc_ci <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

5. What is the *expected* concentration for your qc, in mg/L?  Call it `qc_expected`.

```{r question-5, purl = TRUE}
qc_expected <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

6. TRUE or FALSE: My QC passes.  Answer `TRUE` or `FALSE` in the variable `qc_pass`.

```{r question-6, purl = TRUE}
qc_pass <- FALSE     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

7. What is your sensitivity factor?  Call it `m`.

```{r question-7, purl = TRUE}
m <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

8. What is the $R^2$ value for your calibration curve? Call it `r2`.

```{r question-8, purl = TRUE}
r2 <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

9. What is your limit of detection for quinine (LOD), in mg/L.  Call it `lod`.

```{r question-9, purl = TRUE}
lod <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

10. What is your limit of quantitation for quinine (LOQ), in mg/L.  Call it `loq`.

```{r question-10, purl = TRUE}
loq <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```
