## Assessment

Answer the following questions by saving the result as the specified R variable in an R code block.  These questions are graded automatically.  If you do not name your variable correctly (including capitals) your questions will be marked incorrect.

Each question is worth 1 point.  You must get the question *exactly* right to get credit.

## Assessment

Answer the following questions by saving the result as the specified R variable in an R code block.  These questions are graded automatically.  If you do not name your variable correctly (including capitals) your questions will be marked incorrect.

Each question is worth 1 point.  You must get the question *exactly* right to get credit.

1. What is $R^2$ value for your calibration curve?  Call the variable `r2`.

```{r question-1, purl = TRUE}
r2 <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

2. What is sensitivity factor?  Call the variable `m`.

```{r question-2, purl = TRUE}
m <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

3. What is mean measured analyte concentration for the QC in mg/L?  Call the variable `qc_conc`.

```{r question-3, purl = TRUE}
qc_conc <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

4. What is the expected analyte concentration for the QC in mg/L?  Call the variable `qc_expected`.

```{r question-4, purl = TRUE}
qc_expected <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

5. TRUE or FALSE: My QC passes at the 95% confidence level.  Save your `TRUE` or `FALSE` answer as `qc_passfail`.

```{r question-5, purl = TRUE}
passfail <- FALSE     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

6. What is mean analyte concentration for sample 1 in mg/L?  Call the variable `s1_conc`.

```{r question-6, purl = TRUE}
s1_conc <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

7. What is mean analyte concentration for sample 2 in mg/L?  Call the variable `s2_conc`.

```{r question-7, purl = TRUE}
s2_conc <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

8. What is the 95% CI for sample 1 in mg/L?  Call the variable `s1_ci`.

```{r question-8, purl = TRUE}
s1_ci <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

9. (Acetaminophen Only) What is the 95% CI for sample 2 in mg/L?  Call the variable `s2_ci`.

```{r question-9, purl = TRUE}
s2_ci <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

10. TRUE or FALSE: The concentration of Sample 1 is significantly different from the labeled value.  Save your `TRUE` or `FALSE` answer as `s1_passfail`.

```{r question-10, purl = TRUE}
s1_passfail <- FALSE     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

11. (Acetaminophen Only)  TRUE or FALSE: The concentration of Sample 2 is significantly different from the labeled value.  Save your `TRUE` or `FALSE` answer as `s2_passfail`.

```{r question-11, purl = TRUE}
s2_passfail <- FALSE     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```
