## Assessment

Answer the following questions by saving the result as the specified R variable in an R code block.  These questions are graded automatically.  If you do not name your variable correctly (including capitals) your questions will be marked incorrect.

Each question is worth 1 point.  You must get the question *exactly* right to get credit.

## Assessment

Answer the following questions by saving the result as the specified R variable in an R code block.  These questions are graded automatically.  If you do not name your variable correctly (including capitals) your questions will be marked incorrect.

Each question is worth 1 point.  You must get the question *exactly* right to get credit.

1. What is the mass-to-charge ratio of the base peak in your spectrum?  Call the variable `base`.

```{r question-1, purl = TRUE}
base <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

2. What is the mass-to-charge ratio of the molecular ion?  Call the variable `molion`.

```{r question-2, purl = TRUE}
molion <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

3. How many C atoms are present in your sample?  Call the variable `catoms`.

```{r question-3, purl = TRUE}
catoms <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

4. How many rings and/or double bonds are present in your sample? Call the variable `rdb`.

```{r question-4, purl = TRUE}
rdb <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

5. TRUE or FALSE: My molecule contains an EVEN number of N atoms.  Answer `TRUE` or `FALSE` in the variable `oddeven`.

```{r question-5, purl = TRUE}
oddeven <- FALSE     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

6. What is the monoisotopic molecular weight of your molecule? Call the variable `molwt`.

```{r question-6, purl = TRUE}
molwt <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

7. Propose a formula for your molecule.  Use the variables `c` for number carbon atoms, `h` for number of hydrogen, `o` for oxygen, and `n` for nitrogen.  Your sample will not contain atoms other than these for this lab activity.

```{r question-7, purl = TRUE}
c <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
h <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
o <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
n <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```
