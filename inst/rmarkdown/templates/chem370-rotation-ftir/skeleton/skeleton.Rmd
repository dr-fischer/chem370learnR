## Assessment

Answer the following questions by saving the result as the specified R variable in an R code block.  These questions are graded automatically.  If you do not name your variable correctly (including capitals) your questions will be marked incorrect.

Each question is worth 1 point.  You must get the question *exactly* right to get credit.

1. What is the unique ID (UID) value for Sample 1?  Call the variable `s1_uid`.

```{r question-1, purl = TRUE}
s1_uid <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

1. What is the unique ID (UID) value for Sample 2?  Call the variable `s2_uid`.

```{r question-1, purl = TRUE}
s2_uid <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

1. What is the hit quality index (HQI) value for Sample 1?  Call the variable `s1_hqi`.

```{r question-1, purl = TRUE}
s1_hqi <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

1. What is the hit quality index (HQI) value for Sample 2?  Call the variable `s2_hqi`.

```{r question-1, purl = TRUE}
s2_hqi <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

1. TRUE or FALSE: Sample 1 shows signs of contamination.  Save your `TRUE` or `FALSE` answer as `s1_passfail`.

```{r question-1, purl = TRUE}
s1_passfail <- FALSE     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

1. TRUE or FALSE: Sample 2 shows signs of contamination.  Save your `TRUE` or `FALSE` answer as `s2_passfail`.

```{r question-1, purl = TRUE}
s2_passfail <- TRUE     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```
