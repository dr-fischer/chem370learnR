## Assessment

Answer the following questions by saving the result as the specified R variable in an R code block.  These questions are graded automatically.  If you do not name your variable correctly (including capitals) your questions will be marked incorrect.

Each question is worth 1 point.  You must get the question *exactly* right to get credit.

## Assessment

Answer the following questions by saving the result as the specified R variable in an R code block.  These questions are graded automatically.  If you do not name your variable correctly (including capitals) your questions will be marked incorrect.

Each question is worth 1 point.  You must get the question *exactly* right to get credit.

1. What is your sample ID?  Call it `ID`.

```{r question-1, purl = TRUE}
ID <- "Sample A"  # Delete sample A and insert your sample name.  Leave the quotes.
```

2. Which instrument did you use, the 150 or 400?  Save your answer as the variable `instrument`.

```{r question-2, purl = TRUE}
instrument <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

3. How many compounds are in your sample.  Save your answer as the variable `noCompounds`.

```{r question-3, purl = TRUE}
noCompounds <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

4. What is the percent composition for least polar compound, as a percentage (%)?  Provide your answer as the variable `leastPolarPercent`.

```{r question-4, purl = TRUE}
leastPolarPercent <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

5. What is the percent composition for least polar compound, as a percentage (%)?  Provide your answer as the variable `mostPolarPercent`.

```{r question-5, purl = TRUE}
leastPolarPercent <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

6. What is the standard deviation of the baseline, in millivolts (mV)?  Provide your answer as the variable `baselineSD`.

```{r question-6, purl = TRUE}
baselineSD <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

7. What is the signal level for Peak 1, in millivolts (mV)?  Provide your answer as the variable `peak1`.

```{r question-7, purl = TRUE}
peak1 <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

8. What is the signal level for Peak 1, in millivolts (mV)?  Provide your answer as the variable `peak2`.

```{r question-8, purl = TRUE}
peak2 <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

9. What is the signal to noise ratio for Peak 1?  Provide your answer as the variable `peak1_sn`.

```{r question-9, purl = TRUE}
peak1_sn <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

10. What is the signal to noise ratio for Peak 1?  Provide your answer as the variable `peak2_sn`.

```{r question-10, purl = TRUE}
peak2_sn <- 0     # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```
