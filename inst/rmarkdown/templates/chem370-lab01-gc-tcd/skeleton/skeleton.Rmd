## Assessment

Answer the following questions by saving the result as the specified R variable in an R code block.  These questions are graded automatically.  If you do not name your variable correctly (including capitals) your questions will be marked incorrect.

Each question is worth 1 point.  You must get the question *exactly* right to get credit.

## Assessment

Answer the following questions by saving the result as the specified R variable in an R code block.  These questions are graded automatically.  If you do not name your variable correctly (including capitals) your questions will be marked incorrect.

Each question is worth 1 point.  You must get the question *exactly* right to get credit.

1. What is your sample ID?  Call it `ID`.

```{r question-gc-1, purl = TRUE}
ID <- "Sample Z"  # Delete sample Z and insert your sample name.  Leave the quotes.
```

2. What is the *retention time* of the solvent for the blank on the GC-400, in minutes? Save your answer as `solventPeak.blank`

```{r question-gc-2, purl = TRUE}
solventPeak.blank <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

3. What is the retention time of the *solvent peak* in the sample for the GC-400?  Specify by it's retention time and save your answer as `solventPeak.sample`

```{r question-gc-3, purl = TRUE}
solventPeak.sample <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

4. Does the retention time exactly agree for the blank and the sample?  Write "yes" or "no" and save the answer as `solventPeak.agree`.

```{r question-gc-4, purl = TRUE}
solventPeak.agree <- "no"    # put your answer inside the quotes, and make sure to leave the quotes
```

5. Assuming the peaks do not *exactly* agree, what is the dominant type of error causing the disagreement?  Save the answer as `solventPeak.error`.

```{r question-gc-5, purl = TRUE}
solventPeak.error <- "type"    # put your answer inside the quotes, and make sure to leave the quotes
```

6. How many compounds are in your sample, not including the solvent?  Save your answer as the variable `noCompounds`.

```{r question-gc-6, purl = TRUE}
noCompounds <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

7. What is the percent composition for least polar compound, as a percentage (%), for the GC-400?  Provide your answer as the variable `leastPolarPercent`.

```{r question-gc-7, purl = TRUE}
leastPolarPercent <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

8. What is the percent composition for most polar compound, as a percentage (%), for the GC-400?  Provide your answer as the variable `mostPolarPercent`.

```{r question-gc-8, purl = TRUE}
mostPolarPercent <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

9. What is the range of the baseline values, in millivolts (mV), for the GC-400?  Provide your answer as the variable `baselineRange.400`.

```{r question-gc-9, purl = TRUE}
baselineRange.400 <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

10. What is the signal level for the tallest peak, in millivolts (mV), for the GC-400?  Provide your answer as the variable `signal.400`.

```{r question-gc-10, purl = TRUE}
signal.400 <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

11. What is the signal to noise ratio for the tallest peak in the GC-400?  Provide your answer as the variable `sn.400`.

```{r question-gc-11, purl = TRUE}
sn.400 <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

12. What is the standard deviation of the baseline, in millivolts (mV), for the GC-150?  Provide your answer as the variable `baselineSD.150`.

```{r question-gc-12, purl = TRUE}
baselineSD.150 <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

13. What is the signal level for the tallest peak, in millivolts (mV), for the GC-150?  Provide your answer as the variable `signal.150`.

```{r question-gc-13, purl = TRUE}
signal.150 <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

14. What is the signal to noise ratio for the tallest peak in the GC-150?  Provide your answer as the variable `sn.150`.

```{r question-gc-14, purl = TRUE}
sn.150 <- 0    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```

15. Are the retention times the same or different on each instrument?  Are the peaks separated better on one instrument than another?  Propose some ideas as to why.  Provide your answer as the variable `differences`.

```{r question-gc-15, purl = TRUE}
differences <- "The retention times are exactly the same."    # put your answer between the '<-' and '#'
```
